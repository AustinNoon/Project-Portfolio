# Project Portfolio
My porfolio of personal projects (Austin Noon)

## Contents
- "Space Attack" a simplified rendition of an all time favorite "BattleStar Galactica", programmed using SFML. Features basic collision with the window, bullets, and enemies, as well as a health bar and points system.
- "CSC 212: Data Structures and Abstractions" Term Project, a term project authored by myself and three peers, sorts through numerical input files and outputs sorted versions of those datasets to its own new file. Also displays runtime via a benchmarking function. Implements four different sorting algorithms.
- "FinancialAdvisor" a program built from scratch in Visual Studio using C++. This app features inputting deposits and withdrawals, viewing the history of all your transactions within the app, a budget calculator, and a simple user authentication system.
- "TRON": A rendition of the classic tron game implemented on an Intel Cyclone V FPGA with the use of VHDL. Features building VROM & VRAM, VGAPLL, collision detection, touch screen gesture detection, a custom 16x16 sprites created through a .mif file using hex color codes.
