# Project Portfolio
My porfolio of personal projects (Austin Noon)

## Contents
- "Space Attack" a simplified rendition of an all time favorite "Galaga", programmed using SFML. Features basic collision with the window, bullets, and enemies, as well as a health bar and points system.
- "CSC 212: Data Structures and Abstractions" Term Project, a term project authored by myself and three peers, sorts through numerical input files and outputs sorted versions of those datasets to its own new file. Also displays runtime via a benchmarking function. Implements four different sorting algorithms.
- "FinancialAdvisor" a program built from scratch in Visual Studio using C++. This app features inputting deposits and withdrawals, viewing the history of all your transactions within the app, a budget calculator, and a simple user authentication system.
- "TRON": A rendition of the classic tron game implemented on an Intel Cyclone V FPGA with the use of VHDL. Features building VROM & VRAM, VGAPLL, collision detection, touch screen gesture detection, a custom 16x16 sprites created through a .mif file using hex color codes.
- Task Manager App made with python. Can add, remove, mark tasks as complete, edit tasks, sort tasks by due date, filter by category, and clear all tasks. GUI with multiple buttons and tabs.
- SHA-512 Custom Computer System: A digital custom computer system designed for enhancing the effieciency of the SHA-512 algorithm. This was implemented on an Intel Cyclone V FPGA through the use of Verilog and VHDL. The custom CPU can be interacted with by the user through assembly language programming.
