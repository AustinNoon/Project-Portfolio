# TRON
- This game was brought to life for my ELE301/302 final project. The VRAM and VROM components were created using the Altera MegaWizard Launcher located within Quartus Prime.
- My rendition of TRON features many different functionalities such as collision detection, AI integration, touch gesture recognition, state design, sprite design, and building VRAM & VROM.
- I implemented four different levels of AI difficulty, selectable through the use of touch gestures on the designated sprite buttons. To implement the "smarter" AI functionality, I use various checks of background, the user's player model, the user's player model trail, and the AI's own trail to have the AI calculate its best move.
