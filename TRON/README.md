# TRON
- This game was brought to life for my ELE301/302 final project. The VRAM and VROM components were created using the Altera MeagWizard Launcher located within Quartus Prime.
- This game features many different functionalities such as collision detection, AI integration, touch gesture recognition, state design, sprite design, and building VRAM & VROM.
