# SHA-512 Custom Computer System
## Project Description
- The purpose of this project was to design a custom computer system for the SHA-512 algorithm. This was done as my final project for a Digital Computer Design class, and was a semester-long project. The goal of the project was to emulate SHA-512 on a De1_SoC Intel FPGA board, using the Rhody System we had built during our labs. An important note about the Rhody System is that it uses 32 bit registers, not 64 bit, hence the need to emulate SHA-512. Also note that the Rhody System has three different versions: basic, pipelined, and pipelined with branch prediction. All the modifications for this project are located in "RHODY_CPU_PIPE_BP.vhd". This version of the CPU is the fastest, hence the modifications to the system being in that version. The Rhody System can be interacted with through the custom Rhody assembly language, as can be seen in "SHA-512.asm". Our professor educated us on this version of assembly he had created for the system. 
- The target for this project was to reach 2000 hashes per second, and my version attained 5127 hashes per second. This was done by performing the majority of tasks executed during the SHA-512 algorithm in VHDL rather than the assembly. To accomplish this I had to add several instructions to the pre-existing language: "ADD64", "SUM0", "SUM1", "SIG0", "SIG1", "MAJ", "CH", "SCH3", "SCH4", "SCH51", "SCH52", and "S64", and define them in VHDL.
