# CSC 212 Term Project Fall 2023
- Takes numerical input files and sorts them via CLAs.
- Implements four sorting algorithms: bucket sort, merge sort, insertion sort, and quick sort.
- Prints sorted output to a new file for each algorithm, also displays benchmarked time as well as original data set in the terminal.

## Compiling Instructions
- In the terminal, type " g++ main.cpp datasort.cpp -o generator".
- After it compiles, type "./generator <file.txt" where "file" corresponds to one of the input files of your choosing.
- The program will output four different output files, one for each sorting algorithm.
